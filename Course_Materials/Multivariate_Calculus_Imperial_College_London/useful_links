Khan Academy is a great resource right up to 1st or 2nd year undergraduate material. For this course, there's a handy group of videos at

Grant Sanderson has a great series of videos developing mathematical intuition on YouTube, which you can reach through his site

In Imperial Engineering, our primary maths textbook is probably the ever-popular and accessible Mathematical Methods in the Physical Sciences by Mary L Boas, John Wiley and Sons, 3rd Ed, 2006. Linear Algebra is in Chapter 3.  Most Engineering maths textbooks are also useful, although they often teach 'vectors and matrices' rather than viewing linear algebra as an integrated whole.

In US graduate school classes people often use Introduction to Linear Algebra by Gilbert Strang, Wellesley-Cambridge Press, 5th Ed, 2016.

Wikipedia gets better every year - and the linear algebra wikipedia pages are actually pretty good.
